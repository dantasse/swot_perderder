"Swot Perderder" generator - misspelled foods.

Picks a random food, finds a picture of it, overlays text of a misspelled
version of that food, posts it to twitter.

Includes the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, from: 
http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict
(with a few words added. So if you want the original thing, go find theirs, not
mine.)
