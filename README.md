"Swot Perderder" generator - misspelled foods.

Picks a random food, finds a picture of it, overlays text of a misspelled
version of that food, posts it to twitter.

Includes the [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict)
(with a few words added. So if you want the original thing, go find theirs, not
mine.)

The `scrape_images.py` won't work anymore because it was using an old Google
image search API. Best bet in the future if you want to update this is to use
[Bing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn760791(v=bsynd.50).aspx), I
guess.

Also, at one point I tried to reconfigure this as a Flask app that runs on Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk. I think that was dumb; it can just run on an EC2 free micro instance. Any references that are still around to Flask or EB can be ignored for the time being.
